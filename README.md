📰 Fake News Detector using Machine Learning (SVC)
A machine learning project that detects whether a news article is real or fake using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) model.

🚀 Project Overview
In the age of social media, the spread of fake news has become a critical issue. This project aims to build an intelligent system that can automatically classify news articles as Fake or Real, helping users identify misinformation.

We use TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data into numerical features, and then train an SVC (Support Vector Classifier) to learn the distinction between real and fake news based on word patterns.

🔍 Features
Input: News headline or article text

Output: Real or Fake classification

Text preprocessing: Stopword removal, tokenization, lowercasing

Feature extraction using TF-IDF

Trained using SVC from scikit-learn

High accuracy with efficient performance

🧰 Tech Stack
Python

Scikit-learn – for ML models (SVC)

Pandas, NumPy – for data handling

NLTK / re – for text preprocessing

TF-IDF Vectorizer – for feature extraction

📊 Dataset
Used a labeled dataset from Kaggle containing news articles marked as real or fake.

🧠 Model Used
Support Vector Classifier (SVC) – a supervised learning model that performs binary classification by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the classes in high-dimensional space.
